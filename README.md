# leetcode-playground

Due to my limited ability to solve leetcode problems, I hope to use TDD that I am familiar with to help me find problems in the code. At this stage, I think it is more important to write code and debug quickly with IDEA than mock the whiteboard environment of actual interviews.

Hopefully I can stick with it and finish the daily problem of leetcode every day.

After trying for 2 days, I think the advantage of using unit tests to run the problem is that it saves time. The execution of the program on the leetcode webpage is too slow.
